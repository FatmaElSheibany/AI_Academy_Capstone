# AI_Academy_Capstone
Repository for the capstone project that concluded the 8 week AI Academy course hosted by NeXT SLB at German University of Technology in Oman (Aug - Sep 2023).

The project objective was to use the given datasets of well logs (for 19 unidentified wells) to build a model for predicting lithologies. The model performance was rated via its performance on a separate blind dataset; metric used was weighted F1 score. 

Our team completed the project via a combinatory utilization of Dataiku and Jupyter Notebooks (python), with the latter being primarily used for exploring the data, cleaning and prepping, and the former for the modeling. <b> This repository currently only contains the jupyter notebook with the code that was used for cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.</b>
